Card presence detect / options
  A typical value is 0x7f.
  Bit 7 = Card detect. Must be 0
  Bit 1 = Enables start delay and remote relay. Set to 1 on most cards, except special cards like MC-S01, etc.
  Bit 0 = Only play card once, ignoring repeat count. If 0, then the repeat count from the header will be used.
  All other bits are unknown or unused.
